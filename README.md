# ibmi-sendme
Simple CL and CMD to email DB2 files in CSV format

Compiling
=========
CL member type needs amending to CLLE. 
CMD member type needs amending to CMD. 
Compile both as normal

Invoking
========
Add library list that the objects are deployed.
Type SENDME and add the file that you wish to email to yourself as the first parameter.
The remaining parameters I hope are self explanatory.
